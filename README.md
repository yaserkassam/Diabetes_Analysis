# Diabetes_Analysis

## Summary
  The number of people that have medical conditions in the US is large. One that affects my family 
personally is diabetes. The only way to confirm if someone has diabetes is by taking a test. This test must 
be recommended to you by a doctor. This is by the doctorsâ€™ past experiences of having patients with 
diabetes. My recommendation is creating a model that can correctly predict someone has diabetes 
better than a doctor using their past experiences to suggest it. 

  Can we predict if someone has diabetes or not? My project is to create a binary classification model to 
predict if someone has it or not.
